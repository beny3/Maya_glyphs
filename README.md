# Maya_glyphs

This a JavaScript application made for my Bachelor degree. Its function is to display a large number of images in a cloud, so there are easy to browse. The application also allows to filter the cloud, according to some criteria,  i.e display only certain images.

I use webGL to display a large number of images and move them fast.
In that case the images are Maya ideograms and the criteria are annotations related to each of them.

The application needs a webGL browser, it works on Firefox and Chrome.

I didn't put the server side script. I didn't include the pictures themselves neither because I don't own them, but you can see a working demo here:
